# Title :- Automated Chrome Dino Game
Discription :- The Chrome Dino game is a popular browser-based game that can be found by Google Chrome. It's a simple game where the player controls a dinosaur that runs automatically and has to jump over obstacles by pressing the spacebar. Using Python, it's possible to automate the Chrome Dino game by using a library like PyAutoGUI to control the mouse and keyboard. The basic idea is to use PyAutoGUI to locate the game on the screen, start the game, and then use image recognition to detect when an obstacle is approaching and make the dinosaur jump.
